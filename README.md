## VeLoop

VeLoop is a test application developed as part of a practical training project within Intuita. The development was a collaborative effort aimed at gaining hands-on experience in real-world application design and implementation.

## About the Project

VeLoop serves as a practical tool designed for managing structured data. It allows users to view, edit, and organize Data lists and Ranges, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with these data sets. The primary purpose of this project is educational and experimental, focusing on learning core concepts of data manipulation and user interface development.

This application demonstrates fundamental functionality for handling and organizing data, serving as a foundation for further development and more complex projects.

## Deployment (Live Version)

The current version of the application is deployed and publicly accessible on Vercel at:

https://veloop-six.vercel.app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
